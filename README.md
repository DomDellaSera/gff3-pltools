# bio-hpc-gff3

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mamarjan/bioruby-hpc-gff3.png)](http://travis-ci.org/mamarjan/bioruby-hpc-gff3)

Note: this software is under active development!

This is currently an early work in progress to create a parallel GFF3
and GTF parser library for D and a Ruby gem which would take advantage
of that library.

## Installation

TODO: Write scripts for installation.

### Run tests

Currently only D unit tests are working. You can run them using the
"unittests" rake task, like this:

```sh
    rake unittests
```

## Usage

```ruby
    require 'bio-hpc-gff3'
```

TODO: Generate API docs and find a nice place for them somewhere on
the net.

The API doc is online. For more code examples see the test files in
the source tree.
